# Redux Structure

The application's state is organized by data type. Under each data type, there
may be sub-states. Each action is listed with the sequence of events that
results from its invocation, ending with the API or a reducer. Subscribed
components, i.e. containers, are listed at the end.

Using this document, you should be able to trace an **action** starting with
where it was invoked, through the **API**/**reducer** involved, and finally to
the **components** that update as a result. Once you start implementing your
Redux structure, you'll need to do the same.

## Auth Cycles

* `signUp`
  0. invoked from `SignupForm` `onSubmit`
  0. `POST /api/users` is called.
  0. `receiveCurrentUser` is set as the success callback.
* `logIn`
  0. invoked from `Navbar` `onSubmit`
  0. `POST /api/session` is called.
  0. `receiveCurrentUser` is set as the callback.
* `logOut`
  0. invoked from `Navbar` `onClick`
  0. `DELETE /api/session` is called.
  0. `removeCurrentUser` is set as the success callback.
* `fetchCurrentUser`
  0. invoked from `App` in `didMount`

  0. `receiveCurrentUser` is set as the success callback.

### Session API Response Actions

## Error Cycles

### Error API Response Actions
* `setErrors`
  0. invoked from API callbacks on error for actions that generate POST requests
  0. the `ErrorReducer` stores the `form` in the application's state; `errors` are mapped to their respective forms

  0. the `ErrorReducer` removes `errors` for a given `form` in the application's state.

## Note Cycles

  0. `removeNote` is set as the success callback.

### Notes API Response Actions

  0. invoked from an API callback
  0. the `NoteReducer` updates `notes` in the application's state.

  0. invoked from an API callback
  0. the `NoteReducer` removes `notes[id]` from the application's state.

## Notebook Cycles

### Notebooks API Request Actions

* `removeNotebook`
  0. invoked from an API callback.
  0. The `Notebook` reducer removes `notebooks[id]` from the application's state.

## SearchSuggestion Cycles

* `fetchSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from `NoteSearchBar` `onChange` when there is text
  0. `GET /api/notes` is called with `text` param.
